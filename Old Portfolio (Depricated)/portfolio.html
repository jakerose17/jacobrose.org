							<h2>Upgrading my 3D printer</h2>
							<p>I have been enthralled with 3D printing ever since discovering it at age 14. I used profits from my small business to purchase a cheap kit to build a 3D printer. When I wanted to make dual-color and dual-material 3D prints, I knew that my current printer would not suffice.  However, dual extruder 3D printers were prohibitively expensive, so I upgraded my printer to add a second extruder. I purchased a new nozzle assembly, second stepper motor, and a new motherboard to add a new axis of control.  I designed and 3D printed adapting hardware and assembled the printer (shown in pictures).  After assembly, I modified the firmware to provide control over the extra motor and nozzle. Successfully integrating every part was challenging.  With many individual settings that had to be tuned, I dedicated 2-3 weeks to correcting the software and hardware to produce quality 3D prints.</p>

							<h2>SeaPerch: Underwater Robotics/ROV</h2>
							<p>SeaPerch is an underwater robotics competition in which I competed during the last five years.  Over that time I worked as lead engineer to develop a completely 3D-printed design that improved upon the standard PVC design. This image showcases many generations of designs from back left to front right. One of the most innovative components of our design is a 3D printed gearbox for vertical thrust.  To reduce cross-sectional area and horizontal drag, I designed a 3D printed right-angle gearbox and propeller assembly, seen partially mounted in the last two generations. Developing the gearbox was a challenge, as we were constrained by size and strength of 3D printed parts. Many more iterations of design than shown were required to produce a strong and efficient gearbox. Another issue we encountered was developing the flotation. The body designs depicted in this image show our process of tuning the neutral buoyancy.</p>

							<h2>SeaPerch CAD View</h2>
							<p>This is an exploded view of the final generation of our SeaPerch robot.  We designed the body to print in two parts and have places to mount a weighted inferior hook and superior float to maintain stability in the water.  Cavities for motors and channels for wiring can be seen in the horizontal cross-section. This allowed the robot to be extremely hydrodyamic and therefore have a very high top speed. We had to carefully design the body to be able to be waterproofed after it was 3D-printed.  For example, we included channels on the outside for zip-ties to secure the body rather than screws because the screw holes were unable to be sufficiently sealed with wax.</p>

							<h2>SeaPerch in Action</h2>
							<p>These are two images of our vehicle underwater.  The first is an early generation to test stability and maneuverability in the water. The second image is from an early competition.  This shows the robot lifting a weighted ball through obstacles in the water. In this event, most teams at this competition could not lift these balls as their designs could not handle the extra weight.  Using the same motors as other teams, we were able to complete the challenge by carefully designing our hook and center of buoyancy.  When the vehicle lifted the weight, its pitch would adjust to allow all three motors to provide a component of vertical thrust.</p>

							<h2>SeaPerch Team Over the Years</h2>
							<p>These pictures show my team in 7th grade (above) and 9th grade (below).  We have competed in SeaPerch since 7th grade, beginning with the kit PVC design. We then completely redesigned our underwater robot for our 9th grade year, using 3D printing to innovate in the competition.  The competition officially added a 3D printed category the year after our new design.</p>

							<h2>Eagle Project Designs on Thingiverse</h2>
							<p>For my Eagle Project, I used my experience in 3D printing to lead a team of students in the design of 3D printable sensory fidgets for children with special needs in schools.  We developed these 13 designs to be easily and quickly printed, simple to assemble, and robust. After developing and testing these fidgets, I posted the designs to thingiverse <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/jrose317/designs">here</a> for schools around the world to access. This image shows the designs posted online.</p>

							<h2>Eagle Project: Sensory Room</h2>
							<p>In addition to the 3D printed sensory fidgets available to print by any school, I organized and installed a full sensory room at my local middle school for special needs children. My team and I made most of the sensory tools in the room, including the crash pillows pictured on the left, weighted lap blankets, and visual stimuli with oil, water, and coloring in bottles. We also painted the walls with the simple pattern to improve the room's visual stimulation.</p>

							<h2>Philmont Maps Website</h2>
							<p>After I realized the potential for my 3D topographical maps to sell online, I used my experience in web development to create a website to host my product. I used a free html backbone to provide a structure and coded additional images and pages to customize my website. I use GitHub to host the website at <a href="philmontmaps.com">philmontmaps.com</a>.</p>

							<h2>Philmont Map in CAD</h2>
							<p>After I completed my two-week, 80-mile hiking trek in the Philmont Scout Ranch, I used the 3D topography of the mountain range along with my 2D map I kept during my trek to overlay my path and create a 3D representation of my trek. After I printed my personal model, I realized that this would be a great product to sell through my online Etsy shop, surfsideshack.etsy.com, which I started at age 9.  This image shows the computer-aided-design software representation of my model.</p>

							<h2>The Overflowing Mind</h2>
							<p>This image is my creative poster that I presented at the 2020 State of NC Undergraduate Research and Creativity Symposium.  It shows my sculpture that I made to explore the intersection between art and technology.  I used photogrammetry 3D scanning to produce a computer model of my head.  I then modified this file to produce a mesh representation. Adding thoughts hanging from string inside the sculpture shows the busy mind of a student filled with school, activities, and social life. My artistic concept and voice was focused through the lens of technology.</p>

							<h2>CNC Epoxy Gift</h2>
							<p>Outside of competitions, entrepreneurship, and my Eagle Project, I love to create unique gifts to explore new techniques and push the limits of what I can create.  I purchased a kit CNC machine to explore what I could make with subtractive manufacturing.  I also wanted to create projects with epoxy, so I designed this wooden epoxy sign to showcase both of these methods. These images show the making process, from computer-aided-design to CNC cutting and epoxy finishing.</p>

							<h2>Research in Chemistry Automatic Filament Winder</h2>
							<p>For my independent research project developing a variable-density, bioactive, and biodegradable 3D printer filament for bone reconstructive implants, I needed specialized machinery to manufacture a polymer filament that was able to be assayed. With funding constraints on my research, I could not purchase an automatic 3D printer filament winder. This winder not only stored filament after extrusion, but was integral to creating a constant filament diameter. I coded an Arduino microcontroller to accept inputs from 3 photoresistors and automatically control a motor.  This image shows the electronics as I developed the software and constructed the circuit.</p>

							<h2>Research in Chemistry Project in Action</h2>
							<p>This video shows the filament extruder kit I assembled and the filament winder that I designed and created in action. As the plastic is melted and extruded into a filament, my automatic winder kept a consistent tension on the filament to create a constant diameter. The 3 photoresistors as seen in the video act as "eyes", seeing how much filament is being produced and adjusting the winding rate as needed.</p>

							<h2>Remora CAD Animated</h2>
							<p>For my Entrepreneurship course at my high school, we were tasked with creating a product and considering the product's performance in the market.  My group went one step further, developing a full product rather than just a concept. I designed the computer-aided-design model and 3D printed the product.
Our product is a convertible shower caddy that can be mounted to the wall with suction cups contained inside the caddy when folded. This is ideal for communal living situations such as living on a residence hall with a communal bathroom. I designed this model to print in place, with the hinge being completely self contained and ready to use after printing.
With this design, we decided to take our product to market, so we founded Soji LLC.  We are currently reaching out to injection molding manufacturers to produce our product.</p>

							<h2>Science Olympiad Gravity Vehicle</h2>
							<p>One of my events that I competed in on my Varsity Science Olympiad team was Gravity Vehicle. In the event, we were tasked to design a vehicle that could stop within millimeters of a random target distance while taking the least amount of time. For this event, I used my computer-aided-design experience to create a 3D printed body which had the ability to finely tune the angle of the wheels and contained bearings to improve speed.  I also designed a track for a winged nut to count the number of rotations of the wheels to determine the distance traveled. The lightness and strength of this 3D printed design allowed my team to complete the event in less time and with greater accuracy.</p>

							<h2>Art and Technology Flower</h2>
							<p>I had the opportunity to take the course "Art and Technology" at my high school.  This course used 3D printing and laser cutting to create pieces of art.  For my final project, I wanted to push myself in computer-aided-design and laser cutting, so I decided to create a flower with petals at varying angles.  This is a challenge with laser cutting, as the laser can only create right angles. I used two sheets of plywood as the base with petal cutouts that were offset by a very specific amount to create angled petals. The calculations for this offset is shown in the upper right of this image and the computer render is shown in the upper left. The final product is shown at the bottom.</p>

							<h2>NC Science Fair 2021-State Competition</h2>
							<p>For the 2021 North Carolina Science Fair, my partner and I developed a modular and environmentally-friendly oil filtration system for PVC drains. I modeled the system in computer-aided-design and the render is shown on the right of the image. It contains a central volume to hold the natural oil filter and threads to be easily mounted and replaced on PVC pipe. This system can be easily retrofitted to existing drains to capture oil pollution.
As a state finalist, the project was chosen for the RICOH Sustainable Development Award and the Yale Science and Engineering Award.</p>

									<h2>Maker Portfolio</h2>
									<p>Hi, my name is Jacob Rose. I consider myself a Thinker, Maker, and Doer. Not only do I love learning new topics in and out of class, but I love applying what I have learned to make and create. This website is one example of this. After taking an introductory web development course, I have explored what I can create with code and have made this and other websites. I also love using 3D printing and CNC machining to make custom creations. These are some of my projects that am most proud of.</p>
